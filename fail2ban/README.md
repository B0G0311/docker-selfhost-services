Fail2ban scans log files and bans IP's that show the malicious signs.

*   [Github](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban)
*   [Documentation](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Fail2Ban)
*   [Docker Image](https://github.com/crazy-max/docker-fail2ban)

We are going to be using a prebuilt docker image by crazymax to facilitate the process. There are a lot of fail2ban configurations available on the internet, and you can even create your own, this guide provides the following features :

*   SSH jail configuration
*   [Vaultwarden](#root/qCtO893VeGHe) jail configuration

File structure

```

*   `data/action.d` - a directory containing custom action configuration to execute when banning an IP
*   `data/db` - a directory used to store fail2ban sqlite database
*   `data/filter.d` - a directory containing custom filter configuration used by a jail to match malicious signs
*   `data/jail.d` - a directory containing custom jail configuration for your services
*   `docker-compose.yml` - a docker-compose file, use to configure your applicationâ€™s services

Please make sure that all the files and directories are present.

Information

### docker-compose

Links to the following docker-compose.yml and the corresponding .env.

*   docker-compose.yml

```text-plain
version: '3'

services:
  fail2ban:
    image: crazymax/fail2ban:latest
    container_name: fail2ban
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/log:/var/log:ro
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      - TZ=${TZ}
    network_mode: host
    cap_add:
    - NET_ADMIN
    - NET_RAW
    labels:
      # Watchtower Update
      - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true"
```

*   .env

```text-plain
TZ=
```

We are gonna use `/var/log` directory to parse log files.

### jails

The jail.d directory is provided with three examples.

sshd.conf : provides ssh protection, will ban any IP trying to brute force your ssh credentials, a must-have if you are still on port 22.

bitwarden-auth.conf : protects your vaultwarden password manager from brute force.

bitwarden-admin.conf : protects your vaultwarden admin dashboard from brute force.

You can find the vaultwarden filters in the filter.d directory. For example, in `filter.d/vaultwarden-auth` you can find :

```text-plain
[INCLUDES]
before = common.conf

[Definition]
failregex = ^.*Username or password is incorrect\. Try again\. IP: <HOST>\. Username:.*$
ignoreregex =
```

This filter is using regex and will match any log that fails to connect to your vaultwarden vault. The log file that is parsed is `/var/log/syslog`, redirection is provided with the docker-compose available in the [vaultwarden guide](https://github.com/BaptisteBdn/docker-selfhosted-apps/blob/main/vaultwarden).

Usage
-----

### Configuration

Replace the environment variables in `.env` with your own, then run :

```text-plain
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

The jails and filters configured are going to be active, you can now create as many as you want to protect your services.

### Fail2ban

[Fail2ban commands](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Commands) can be used through the container. Here is an example if you want to unban an IP manually:

```text-plain
sudo docker exec -t fail2ban fail2ban-client set <JAIL> unbanip <IP>
```

The same example with [vaultwarden](#root/qCtO893VeGHe), in the case you failed to enter the right password 3 times:

```text-plain
sudo docker exec -t fail2ban fail2ban-client set bitwarden-auth unbanip <IP>
```

For a more general example, you can use any fail2ban command as follows:

```text-plain
sudo docker exec -t fail2ban fail2ban-client <COMMAND>
```

### Update

The image is automatically updated with [watchtower](#root/erRihXn8XDdG) thanks to the following label :

```text-plain
  # Watchtower Update  - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true"
```

Security
--------

Be careful not to get ban as the iptable action is pretty aggressive, you will not be able to SSH with the banned IP.

Backup
------

Docker volumes are globally backed up using [borg-backup](https://github.com/BaptisteBdn/docker-selfhosted-apps/blob/main/borg-backup).
